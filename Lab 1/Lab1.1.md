## Lab 1.1

### What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool ?
- Conduct preliminary screening of vendors

- Contact vendors for information

- Conduct site visits or meetings with finalist vendors and then do the final selection

- The tools have to meet the needs of the organization

- Request a written response to the CASE requirements from vendors and a loan of the tools for evaluation

- Accomplishing of Test-oriented requirements before taking the engineering tool on floors

- Flexibility of the engineering tool to support the processes and methodologies that are already in use in
the Organization

- Scalability: The tool should be able to handle the size and complexity of the project and accommodate future growth and changes in requirements

- Requirements traceability mechanism

- Requirements analysis mechanism

- Security and accessibility mechanism

- Portability and backend compatibility

- Configuration management approach

- Communication and collaboration mechanism

- Change management support

- Online publishing support

- Usability features such as word processor compatibility

- SRS documentation format

- Training and learning curve effort

- Agile, CI/CD, and DevOps

- Intelligent support

### Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities ?
- The tool market is rapidly changing, and tools are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to use.

- The complexity of the expensive commercial tools then creates opportunities for inexpensive tools to emerge, but donâ€™t offer sophisticated features.

- Furthermore, validation functionalities such as consistency, correctness, and completeness are still lacking in most of the tools.

- Some tools of requirement engineering are unreliable and not feasible for some situations.

### When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for ?
- Documentation and resources: Check if the tool has comprehensive documentation, user guides, tutorials, and forums that can help you understand and use the tool effectively.

- Security and stability: Verify the tool's security measures and stability to ensure that your requirements data is protected and the tool operates reliably.

- Licensing: Understand the open-source license associated with the tool and ensure it aligns with your organization's requirements and policies.

- Compatibility and integration: Assess whether the open-source tool can integrate with other tools or systems in your organization's software development ecosystem.

- Save cost: We can look for these tools before purchasing or trying to develop a tool from scratch.

- Feature: There are also utilities or resources for requirements engineering.





### If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced ?
- Yes. But it should be done thoughtfully, use the tool judiciously and follow certain best practices. These situations are complex and they present a high levels of ambiguity, uncertainty and emergence. Dealing with these complex situations may require a change in paradigm.

### How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities ? What are the drawbacks in this regard ?
- Due to the fact that tools provide workers with adequate resources to function more effectively and cooperatively, they can facilitate dispersed, global requirements engineering tasks. Machines, paper, computers, laptops, auxiliary equipment, stationery, and other items that are needed by laborers and workers to work effectively might be considered tools. Employee productivity rises when tools are available, and this contributes to the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the firm.

- The disadvantages in this regard include that, occasionally, employees use the availability of technologies for immoral purposes, misusing them for personal gain rather than for organizational needs. This causes these tools and resources to be abused and exploited, which lowers


### What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one ?
- Problem: Traceability can highlight areas where needs aren't fully covered, for as when certain features or components don't have matching requirements.

- Representation: To guarantee complete coverage, the missing criteria might be included to the specification.

### How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications ?
- Various methodologies and approaches are being suggested to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) for knowledge gathering and representation in requirements specifications. By automating or assisting in the extraction, analysis, and representation of pertinent knowledge from diverse sources, the requirements engineering process is to be improved.
- While artificial intelligence (AI) has several benefits for representing and acquiring information, there are drawbacks as well, such as:

  + Data Bias and Quality: Incomplete or biased data might result in skewed or erroneous requirements. Therefore, the quality of the input data is very important.
  + Interpretability: AI models have to be understandable to interested parties, particularly in regulated sectors where transparency and traceability are crucial.
  + Human Validation: To make sure that automated requirements correctly reflect the user's purpose, people should validate the requirements.
  + Ethical Considerations: AI may unintentionally reinforce preexisting prejudices in specifications. It is important to take precautions against this and make sure AI is used ethically in requirements engineering.
  + Requirements engineering may be made much more effective and efficient by AI, but it should only be utilized in conjunction with human experience.
