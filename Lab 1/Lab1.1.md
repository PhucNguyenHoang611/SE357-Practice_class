## Lab 1.1

### What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool ?
- Conduct preliminary screening of vendors

- Contact vendors for information

- Conduct site visits or meetings with finalist vendors and then do the final selection

- The tools have to meet the needs of the organization

- Request a written response to the CASE requirements from vendors and a loan of the tools for evaluation

- Accomplishing of Test-oriented requirements before taking the engineering tool on floors

- Flexibility of the engineering tool to support the processes and methodologies that are already in use in
the Organization

- Scalability: The tool should be able to handle the size and complexity of the project and accommodate future growth and changes in requirements

- Requirements traceability mechanism

- Requirements analysis mechanism

- Security and accessibility mechanism

- Portability and backend compatibility

- Configuration management approach

- Communication and collaboration mechanism

- Change management support

- Online publishing support

- Usability features such as word processor compatibility

- SRS documentation format

- Training and learning curve effort

- Agile, CI/CD, and DevOps

- Intelligent support

### Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities ?
- The tool market is rapidly changing, and tools are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to use.

- The complexity of the expensive commercial tools then creates opportunities for inexpensive tools to emerge, but donâ€™t offer sophisticated features.

- Furthermore, validation functionalities such as consistency, correctness, and completeness are still lacking in most of the tools.

- Some tools of requirement engineering are unreliable and not feasible for some situations.

### When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for ?
- Documentation and resources: Check if the tool has comprehensive documentation, user guides, tutorials, and forums that can help you understand and use the tool effectively.

- Security and stability: Verify the tool's security measures and stability to ensure that your requirements data is protected and the tool operates reliably.

- Licensing: Understand the open-source license associated with the tool and ensure it aligns with your organization's requirements and policies.

- Compatibility and integration: Assess whether the open-source tool can integrate with other tools or systems in your organization's software development ecosystem.

- Save cost: We can look for these tools before purchasing or trying to develop a tool from scratch.

- Feature: There are also utilities or resources for requirements engineering.

### If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced ?
- Yes. But it should be done thoughtfully, use the tool judiciously and follow certain best practices. These situations are complex and they present a high levels of ambiguity, uncertainty and emergence. Dealing with these complex situations may require a change in paradigm.

### How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities ? What are the drawbacks in this regard ?


### What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one ?


### How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications ?
